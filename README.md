# Object Detection using Hough, Ransac and Template Matching
This project was created as part of my bachelor thesis. The goal is to recognize and classify objects in images using the three named methods. In addition to the existing Matlab script files, an application was designed that cannot be uploaded due to the file size.


## Functionality:
First, an image is selected with the odImagePreprocessing module and converted to a gray scale image. Then the odCannyEdge module converts the gray scale image to a binary edge image.
